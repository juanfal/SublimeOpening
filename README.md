# SublimeOpening
Suitable for keyboard shortcut, it opens either Finder selection or Front Window with Sublime (easy to customise)

I've it as an Automator with only one action, an applescript with this code,
and I've it attached to a keyboard shortcut cmd-opt-ctrl-M under Services available in Finder without input data
